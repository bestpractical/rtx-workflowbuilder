Development
------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to run RTx::WorkflowBuilder's tests, you need to
set a few environment variables
RT_DBA_USER - a user who can create a database on your 
              RDBMS (such as root on mysql)
RT_DBA_PASSWORD - the password for RT_DBA_USER
PERL5LIB - the path to your RT libraries (/opt/rt3/lib)

RT_DBA_USER=user RT_DBA_PASSWORD=password PERL5LIB=/opt/rt3/lib make test

These are intended to be run before installing RTx::WorkflowBuilder.
Like RT, RTx::WorkflowBuilder expects to be able to create a new
database called rt3test on your system.
